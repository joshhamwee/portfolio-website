          <h3>Harrow School</h3>
          <p>
            I spent 5 years of my schooling life at Harrow School. It was here
            that my interest in computing started. Towards the final years of my
            stint there I ran the computer science society, and it was from that
            point I knew I would pursue this as my career. It was here that I
            took my A Levels, which included Maths, Futher Maths, Phyics &
            Design Technology.

          <h3>Reliance ACSN</h3>
          <p>
            During the summer of 2018 I spent a week working under the
            penetration testing team of the Cyber Security firm Reliance ACSN.
            It was here that I was introduced to a wide range of concepts
            related to this field. I am returning in the summer of 2019 for an
            extended period of time to learn more about the company and broaded
            my skill set.

          <p>
            I spent a short duration of my summer holidays of 2018 working for
            the technology, design & innovation studio called Crowdform. It was
            here that I enhanced my web development skills by studying
            Javascript. I picked up the language relatively quickly due to my
            understanding of HTML and CSS prior to my arrival.
